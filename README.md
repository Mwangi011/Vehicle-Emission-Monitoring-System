# IoT-Based CO2 and Dust Concentration Monitoring for Vehicles

Description:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project designed to monitor CO2 and dust concentration levels inside vehicles. The system leverages an ELT sensor for particulate matter detection and a gas sensor for CO2 monitoring. Using IoT technology, real-time sensor data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for visualization, analysis, and alert generation when pollutant levels exceed safe limits.

Features:

Real-time monitoring of CO2 and dust levels.
Integration with ThingSpeak for data visualization and analysis.
Configurable alert system for unsafe air quality levels.
Modular and scalable codebase for easy adaptation.

Applications:
This project is ideal for implementing smart air quality management systems in vehicles, enhancing passenger comfort and safety.
